# AAARRrerg
Pirate shooter made for Circudelia launch party

Things to do:
* Replace random font with images - at the moment need to install font to play properly
* Split player 1 & 2's scores - at the gig it was a teamwork game so merged scores
* Move ini file location and possibly encrypt - this is used for the high-score table

Install Instructions
* Move AAARRrerg.exe to your local machine, it doesn't matter where.
* Move bin.ini to C:\Temp, create if necessary. I know this is dirty but I wanted to hide the hi-score table from prying eyes at short notice... I should have just hidden it.
* Install RAPSCALL.ttf by right-clicking and selecting 'Install'. Once again, this is really dirty.
* Run AAARRrerg.exe.
